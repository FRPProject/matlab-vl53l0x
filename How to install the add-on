To install it on Matlab go to the software packages directory (e.g., C:\ProgramData\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2017a_1\toolbox\matlab\hardware\supportpackages) and just copy paste it into: "+arduinoioaddons". Copy *.h file into "+arduinoioaddons/src". 
Then execute the following commands:
clear classes
rehash toolboxcache
lib = listArduinoLibraries()
You should see the newly installed add-on
