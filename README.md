# matlab-vl53l0x
Matlab Arduino add-on library for Adafruit VL53L0X sensor
This is a Matlab extension that allows Matlab to receive distance data from the VL53L0X Time of Flight distance sensor. Basically
it wraps the Adafruit libraries in Matlab compatible code.

You will need:
Matlab - this extension is tested with R2017A and may or may not work with earlier versions
the Matlab hardware support package for Arduino
Arduino software
the Adafruit/VL53L0X libraries installed through arduino

Put the extension somewhere on a drive and add it to Matlab with addpath.
