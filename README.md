# matlab-vl53l0x
Matlab Arduino add-on library for the Adafruit VL53L0X sensor
This is a Matlab extension that allows Matlab to receive distance data from the VL53L0X Time of Flight distance sensor. It
wraps the Adafruit libraries in Matlab compatible code.

Requirements:

Matlab - this extension is tested with R2017a and may or may not work with earlier versions

the Matlab hardware support package for Arduino

Arduino software

the Adafruit_VL53L0X libraries installed through Arduino

Usage:

Put the extension somewhere on a drive and add it to Matlab with addpath; you can verify it was found with the
listArduinoLibraries command.

Create an Arduino object in Matlab with

> a = arduino('COM3','Uno','Libraries','Adafruit/VL53L0X')

(using your correct com port and board type.)

Create a sensor object with

> v = addon(a,'Adafruit/VL53L0X')

Initialize the sensor before taking measurements

> begin(v)

Now the device is ready to read distance

> mm = rangeMilliMeter(v)
